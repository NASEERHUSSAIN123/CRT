### üìä Process States

A process transitions through multiple states during its lifetime:

| **State**     | **Description**                                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **New**       | Process is being created.                                  |
| **Ready**     | Process is waiting to be assigned to the CPU.              |
| **Running**   | Instructions are being executed by the CPU.                |
| **Waiting**   | Process is waiting for some event (I/O, etc.).             |
| **Terminated**| Process has finished execution.                            |

---

### üîÑ State Transition Diagram
Shows how a process moves between these states.

### üßæ Process Control Block (PCB)

Each process is represented in the Operating System by a **PCB**, which stores important information about the process.

| **Component**             | **Details**                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Process ID (PID)**      | Unique identifier for the process                |
| **Program Counter**       | Address of the next instruction                  |
| **CPU Registers**         | Current state of registers                       |
| **Memory Management Info**| Base/limit registers, page tables                |
| **Accounting Info**       | CPU usage, time limits                           |
| **I/O Status Info**       | List of open files, devices used                 |

‚úîÔ∏è **PCB is critical for process switching.**
### Threads
- A thread is an smallest unit of CPU execution.
- A process can have multiple threads
### üßµ Multithreading Module

**Multithreading** is a technique where a single process can have multiple threads of execution. Each thread shares the same memory space but executes independently.

#### üîë Key Points:
- Threads share code, data, and resources.
- Improves application performance on multi-core systems.
- Reduces context switching overhead compared to multiple processes.

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:
- Efficient CPU utilization
- Faster context switching than processes
- Better resource sharing
- Responsiveness in interactive applications

---

### üß† CPU Scheduling

**CPU Scheduling** is the process of determining which process will own the CPU for execution while others are waiting in the queue.

#### üéØ Goal of CPU Scheduling:
- Maximize CPU utilization
- Minimize waiting and response time
- Achieve fairness among processes

---

### üßÆ CPU Scheduling Algorithms

There are several CPU scheduling algorithms used by operating systems to decide the order of process execution:

#### 1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- Non-preemptive
- Processes are executed in the order of arrival
- Simple but can lead to **convoy effect**

#### 2. **Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- Non-preemptive
- Process with the shortest burst time is executed first
- Optimal but difficult to predict burst time

#### 3. **Round Robin (RR)**
- Preemptive
- Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum)
- Fair and good for time-sharing systems

#### 4. **Priority Scheduling**
- Can be preemptive or non-preemptive
- Each process is assigned a priority
- Lower priority processes may suffer **starvation**

#### 5. **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**
- Processes are divided into queues based on priority or type (foreground/background)
- Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm

#### 6. **Multilevel Feedback Queue**
- Dynamic priority adjustment based on process behavior
-  Allows a process to move between queues

---
### üîÑ What is Synchronization?

**Synchronization** is the coordination or control of the execution sequence of threads or processes that share resources (like memory, files, etc.) in a concurrent system.

üß† **Goal:**  
To ensure that only one process/thread accesses the critical resources at a time and avoids **data inconsistency**.

---

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Race Condition

A **race condition** occurs when two or more processes access shared resources concurrently, and the final result depends on the **timing** of their execution.

üìå **Example:**
If two threads try to update the same bank account balance simultaneously, the final balance might be incorrect if proper synchronization is not used.

---

#### üîê Critical Section Problem

The **critical section** is the part of the program where the process accesses shared resources (variables, files, etc.).

The **Critical Section Problem** is about designing a protocol that ensures:
- Only one process can be in the critical section at a time.
- No process is unnecessarily delayed.

---

#### ‚úÖ Requirements to Solve the Critical Section Problem

1. **Mutual Exclusion**  
   - Only one process can enter the critical section at a time.

2. **Progress**  
   - If no process is in the critical section, and some processes wish to enter, one of them must be allowed to proceed.

3. **Bounded Waiting**  
   - There must be a limit on the number of times other processes can enter their critical sections before a waiting process is allowed to enter.

---

üí° These requirements are essential for designing synchronization mechanisms like:
- Semaphores
- Mutexes
- Monitors
- Peterson‚Äôs Algorithm

---

Let me know if you want code examples (e.g., using semaphores or mutexes) or a flowchart to visualize this!

### ‚ùå What is Deadlock?

A **deadlock** is a situation in operating systems where a group of processes are **permanently blocked**, each waiting for a resource that another process in the group is holding.

üìå In simpler terms:  
Every process is waiting for a resource that is being held by another, and none can proceed ‚Äî causing a standstill.

---

#### üîí Necessary Conditions for Deadlock

For a deadlock to occur, **all four** of the following conditions must hold simultaneously:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**  
   - At least one resource must be held in a **non-shareable** mode.
   - Only one process can use the resource at any given time.

2. **Hold and Wait**  
   - A process is holding at least one resource and is **waiting** to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other processes.

3. **No Preemption**  
   - Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process; they must be released **voluntarily**.

4. **Circular Wait**  
   - A **circular chain** of processes exists where each process is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.

---

üß† **Example of Circular Wait**:
- P1 is waiting for R2, held by P2  
- P2 is waiting for R3, held by P3  
- P3 is waiting for R1, held by P1  
‚Üí Deadlock occurs.

---

üîÅ If any one of these conditions can be **prevented or broken**, deadlock can be avoided.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to add:
- Deadlock **prevention**, **avoidance**, or **detection** strategies  
- A **diagram** or table for better visualization
#### üö® Deadlock Detection and Recovery

When a system **does not prevent or avoid deadlocks**, it must be able to **detect** when a deadlock has occurred and take **action to recover** from it.

---

### üîç Deadlock Detection

Deadlock detection involves **checking** the current state of system resources and processes to find cycles in the **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)**.

- A **cycle** in RAG ‚Üí **May** indicate a deadlock (for single-instance resources, it **definitely** does).
- The system uses algorithms to detect deadlocks periodically or on demand.

#### üìò Example Detection Algorithm:
For multiple instances of resources:
- Use a variation of **Banker's Algorithm**
- Maintain data structures:  
  - **Available** (resources not allocated)  
  - **Allocation** (resources held by each process)  
  - **Request** (current resource requests by processes)

---

### üí° Recovery from Deadlock

Once a deadlock is detected, the system must **recover**. There are several strategies:

#### 1. **Process Termination**
- Abort one or more processes to break the circular wait.
- Options:
  - Abort all deadlocked processes (drastic)
  - Abort one at a time until the deadlock is resolved (minimal)

#### 2. **Resource Preemption**
- Temporarily take away (preempt) resources from some processes and give them to others.
- Must ensure:
  - No starvation
  - Rollback to safe states

---

### üìù Considerations:
- Choose the victim process based on:
  - Priority
  - Time executed
  - Resources used
  - Number of rollbacks required

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:
- Detection allows deadlocks to occur, but requires sophisticated algorithms.
- Recovery must be carefully handled to avoid **data inconsistency** or **process starvation**.

Let me know if you'd like a **diagram or pseudo-code** for the detection algorithm.
# üß† Memory Management

## üìç Logical Address vs Physical Address

In memory management, the terms **logical address** and **physical address** refer to the way memory is accessed by a program and the actual location in hardware memory (RAM).

| Feature                 | Logical Address                              | Physical Address                             |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Address generated by the **CPU**             | Actual address in **main memory (RAM)**       |
| **Visibility**          | Visible to the **user/program**              | Not visible to the user; used by the system   |
| **Used By**             | Generated by the **compiler or CPU**         | Used by the **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**  |
| **Binding Time**        | Occurs at **compile, load, or execution time**| Final mapping done at execution time          |
| **Role**                | Acts as a reference during program execution | Represents the **actual memory location**     |
| **Example**             | A variable at address `0x00A3` in the code   | May be mapped to RAM address `0xFF0A3`        |

---

### üéØ Key Concepts

- **Logical Address** = Virtual Address
- **Physical Address** = Actual RAM Address
- The **MMU (Memory Management Unit)** translates logical addresses into physical addresses during runtime.

---

### üß© Why this matters?

Logical addressing allows:
- **Process isolation** (each process thinks it has its own memory space)
- **Security** (prevents direct hardware access)
- **Flexibility** (easier memory management via virtual memory)

Let me know if you'd like a **diagram of address translation** or how **paging/segmentation** fits into this.
## üì¶ Contiguous Memory Allocation

**Contiguous Memory Allocation** is a memory management technique in which **each process is allocated a single contiguous block of memory** in the main memory (RAM).

---

### üß† Key Features:
- Entire process is loaded into one continuous section of memory.
- Requires memory to be allocated in advance.
- Uses **base and limit registers** to protect memory space.

---

### ‚úÖ Advantages:
- Simple to implement.
- Easy to manage using base and limit registers.
- Fast access due to sequential memory blocks.

---

### ‚ùå Disadvantages:
- Suffers from **external fragmentation**.
- Limits process size to available contiguous block.
- Difficult to allocate memory efficiently as processes are created and terminated.

---
## üß© Fragmentation

**Fragmentation** refers to the **wastage of memory** that occurs when memory is **allocated inefficiently**, leading to unusable free space.

---

### üìÇ Types of Fragmentation

1. **Internal Fragmentation**
   - Occurs when **fixed-sized memory blocks** are allocated to processes, and the process does **not use the full block**.
   - The **unused space inside the allocated block** is wasted.
   - Common in systems using **paging**.

   ‚úÖ Example:
   If a memory block is 4KB and a process needs 3.6KB, then 0.4KB is wasted internally.

2. **External Fragmentation**
   - Occurs when **free memory is scattered** across the system in small blocks.
   - Even though total free memory is enough, it is **not contiguous**, so **large processes can't be allocated**.

---

## üö® Problem: External Fragmentation

**External Fragmentation** happens when **free memory exists**, but it is **spread out in small chunks**, making it **useless for larger processes**.

---

### üß± Example:

Imagine memory is divided as follows:

- Total Free Memory = 10 + 5 + 20 = **35KB**
- Process Request = **25KB**

üö´ **Not Allocated** ‚Üí Because there‚Äôs no **single contiguous block** of 25KB.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions to External Fragmentation

1. **üîÅ Compaction**
   - Moves all used blocks together to **create one large free block**.
   - Expensive operation; usually done during system idle time.

2. **üì¶ Paging**
   - Memory is divided into **fixed-size pages**; processes are also divided accordingly.
   - Pages can be stored **non-contiguously** in memory.
   - ‚úîÔ∏è Eliminates **external fragmentation**.
   - ‚ùå May cause **internal fragmentation**.

3. **üìê Segmentation**
   - Memory is divided into **variable-sized segments** (code, data, stack).
   - Reduces external fragmentation compared to contiguous allocation.
   - Each segment can grow or shrink independently.

---

Let me know if you'd like:
- A **diagram** of memory fragmentation
- A **comparison table** of internal vs external fragmentation
- Visual explanation of **paging** or **segmentation**
### üì¶ Paging

**Paging** is a **memory management scheme** that eliminates the problem of **external fragmentation** by allowing physical memory to be **non-contiguous**.

---

### üîç Key Concepts of Paging:

| Concept             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Page**            | Fixed-size **block of logical (virtual) memory**                           |
| **Frame**           | Fixed-size **block of physical memory (RAM)**                              |
| **Page Table**      | A data structure used to **map logical pages to physical frames**          |
| **Page Number**     | Index of the page in the logical address                                    |
| **Page Offset**     | Offset inside the page to reach the actual data                            |

---

### üìñ How Paging Works:

1. The **logical address** generated by the CPU is divided into:
   - **Page number (p)** ‚Äî used to index the page table
   - **Offset (d)** ‚Äî specifies the exact location within the page

2. The **page table** maps each page number to a **frame number** in physical memory.

3. The final **physical address** is calculated by combining:
   - Frame number (from page table)
   - Offset (from the logical address)

üìå This process is handled by the **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**.

---

### üß† Example:

Assume:
- Page size = 4KB
- Logical address = 13-bit: `p = 5 bits`, `d = 8 bits`
- Page number = 10101 ‚Üí Page Table gives Frame number = 11000
- Offset = 01101100

üü∞ Physical Address = Frame number + Offset = `11000 01101100`

---

### ‚úÖ Advantages of Paging:

- Eliminates **external fragmentation**
- Allows **efficient and flexible** memory use
- Enables use of **virtual memory**

### ‚ùå Disadvantages:

- May cause **internal fragmentation** (last page not fully used)
- Extra memory needed for **page tables**
- Slight **performance overhead** due to address translation

---

Let me know if you want:
- A **diagram** showing logical to physical address translation
- Explanation of **multi-level paging** or **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)**
### üìê Segmentation

**Segmentation** is a **memory management technique** where memory is divided into **variable-sized segments**, each representing a logical unit such as a function, array, stack, or data.

Unlike paging (which divides memory into fixed-size blocks), segmentation is based on **logical divisions** of a program.

---

### üîç Key Concepts of Segmentation:

| Concept              | Description                                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Segment**          | A logical unit such as code, data, or stack                              |
| **Segment Number**   | Identifier for each segment                                               |
| **Offset**           | Position within the segment                                               |
| **Segment Table**    | Maps each segment number to a segment base address and limit (length)    |

---

### üìñ How Segmentation Works:

1. A **logical address** in segmentation consists of:
   - **Segment number (s)**
   - **Offset within the segment (d)**

2. The **segment table** contains:
   - **Base**: starting physical address of the segment in memory
   - **Limit**: length of the segment

3. The MMU (Memory Management Unit) checks:
   - If `offset < limit`, then **physical address = base + offset`
   - Otherwise, it raises an **invalid memory access error**

---

### üß† Example:

Assume:
- Segment table entry for segment 2: base = 5000, limit = 1000
- Logical address = (2, 400)

‚úîÔ∏è Physical address = 5000 + 400 = **5400**

If offset = 1200 (greater than limit), ‚ùå segmentation fault occurs.

---

### ‚úÖ Advantages of Segmentation:

- Reflects **logical program structure** (code, data, stack, etc.)
- Allows for **protection and sharing** at segment level
- Supports **dynamic growing** of segments like stack or heap

---

### ‚ùå Disadvantages:

- May cause **external fragmentation**
- More **complex memory management** than paging
- **Variable-sized segments** make memory allocation harder

---

### üìå Comparison: Paging vs Segmentation

| Feature            | Paging                           | Segmentation                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Division Type      | Fixed-size pages                 | Variable-size segments             |
| Logical View       | Not visible to programmer        | Matches logical divisions          |
| Fragmentation Type | Internal fragmentation possible  | External fragmentation possible    |
| Translation        | Page table                       | Segment table                      |

---

Let me know if you want:
- A **diagram of segmentation address translation**
- Combined concept: **Paged Segmentation or Segmented Paging**
### Virtual Memory
Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides the illusion of a large, contiguous memory space using both physical RAM and disk storage (swap space).

**Key Concepts:**
- **Paging**: Divides memory into fixed-size pages; managed by the OS.
- **Segmentation**: Divides memory into variable-size segments based on program structure.
- **Page Table**: Maps virtual addresses to physical addresses.
- **Thrashing**: Performance degradation due to excessive paging.

---

### Page Replacement Algorithms
These algorithms determine which memory pages to replace when new pages need to be loaded into memory.

**Common Algorithms:**
- **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)**: Replaces the oldest loaded page.
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Replaces the page that hasn't been used for the longest time.
- **Optimal**: Replaces the page that won't be used for the longest time in the future (ideal but theoretical).
- **Clock (Second Chance)**: Gives each page a second chance before replacing.
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Replaces the least frequently accessed page.

---

### File Attributes
File attributes are metadata about files used by the operating system to manage them.

**Common Attributes:**
- **Name**: Identifier of the file.
- **Type**: Indicates file format or extension.
- **Location**: Address on storage media.
- **Size**: Total bytes used by the file.
- **Protection**: Permissions for read/write/execute.
- **Time and Date**: Timestamps for creation, modification, and access.
- **User ID**: Owner of the file.

---

### File Operations
File operations are basic actions supported by the operating system for manipulating files.

**Basic Operations:**
- **Create**: Make a new file.
- **Open**: Access a file for reading or writing.
- **Read**: Retrieve data from a file.
- **Write**: Store data to a file.
- **Seek**: Move the file pointer to a different location.
- **Close**: End access to the file.
- **Delete**: Remove the file.
- **Rename**: Change the file's name.
### File Allocation Methods

File allocation refers to how disk blocks are assigned to files in a file system. The operating system uses different strategies for organizing and managing file storage.

---

#### 1. Contiguous Allocation
- **Description**: Each file occupies a set of contiguous blocks on the disk.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to implement.
  - Fast sequential and direct access.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Causes external fragmentation.
  - Difficult to grow files dynamically.

**Example**:  
`File A: [100, 101, 102, 103]`

---

#### 2. Linked Allocation
- **Description**: Each file is a linked list of disk blocks; blocks may be scattered anywhere on the disk.
- **Advantages**:
  - No external fragmentation.
  - Easy to grow files.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Only sequential access (no random access).
  - Overhead due to pointers.

**Example**:  
`File A: [100] ‚Üí [305] ‚Üí [900] ‚Üí NULL`

---

#### 3. Indexed Allocation
- **Description**: An index block contains all the pointers to the file's data blocks.
- **Advantages**:
  - Supports both sequential and direct access.
  - No external fragmentation.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires extra space for index blocks.

**Example**:  
`Index Block for File A: [100, 305, 900, 450]`

---

Each allocation method is suitable for different use cases, balancing trade-offs in performance, complexity, and space efficiency.
### Disk Management

Disk management is a core function of an operating system responsible for managing the storage devices and the data stored on them. It involves organizing, maintaining, and allocating disk space efficiently to ensure system performance and data integrity.

---

#### Key Functions of Disk Management:

- **Partitioning**: Dividing a physical disk into logical sections called partitions. Each partition can have its own file system.
- **Formatting**: Preparing a partition with a specific file system so it can store data (e.g., NTFS, FAT32, ext4).
- **Mounting and Unmounting**: Making a file system accessible to the OS by attaching it to a directory structure (mounting) and removing it (unmounting).
- **Disk Scheduling**: Determines the order in which read/write requests are handled to optimize performance.
- **Space Management**: Tracks free and used space on the disk using structures like bitmaps or free lists.
- **Bad Block Management**: Identifies and marks unusable disk blocks to avoid data corruption.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Enables data restoration in case of hardware failure or data loss.

---

#### Disk Scheduling Algorithms:

1. **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**: Requests are processed in the order they arrive.
2. **SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**: Chooses the request closest to the current head position.
3. **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**: Head moves in one direction fulfilling requests, then reverses.
4. **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**: Like SCAN, but only services requests in one direction, then jumps back.
5. **LOOK and C-LOOK**: Similar to SCAN/C-SCAN but only goes as far as the last request in each direction.

---

Disk management is crucial for efficient storage use, system reliability, and maintaining data access performance.

# üñ•Ô∏è Multitasking vs Multiprogramming vs Multiprocessing

These three are core concepts in Operating Systems that help improve **CPU utilization**, **responsiveness**, and **system performance**, but they differ in **execution strategy and hardware usage**.

---

## üîÑ 1. Multitasking

> **Multitasking** is the ability of an OS to execute **multiple tasks (processes)** seemingly at the same time.

### ‚úÖ Key Points:
- Involves **time-sharing**.
- One CPU switches between tasks rapidly (context switching).
- Creates the illusion of parallelism.
- Used in personal computers and mobile devices.

### üí° Example:
Running a browser, media player, and text editor at the same time.

---

## üì¶ 2. Multiprogramming

> **Multiprogramming** is a method to improve CPU utilization by **loading multiple programs** into memory and running them one after the other.

### ‚úÖ Key Points:
- Only **one program executes at a time**.
- CPU is kept busy by choosing another program when the current one waits (e.g., for I/O).
- Requires memory management and job scheduling.
- Found in batch processing systems.

### üí° Example:
If Program A is waiting for disk I/O, Program B uses the CPU.

---

## üß† 3. Multiprocessing

> **Multiprocessing** uses **two or more CPUs (processors)** to run processes **in true parallelism**.

### ‚úÖ Key Points:
- Real concurrent execution.
- Increases **throughput**, **fault tolerance**, and **reliability**.
- More complex to manage (synchronization, communication).
- Used in servers, supercomputers, and modern multicore systems.

### üí° Example:
Running multiple programs simultaneously on a **multi-core processor**.
