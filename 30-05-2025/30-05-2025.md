## Gready Algorithm
- The gready algorithm eay of solving a problem by choosing best option at each step hoping it leads to the best over all solution, but it is not optimal solution always.
## Backtracking Algorithm
- Backtracking is a recurrence based algorithm where we have to find all feasible solutions, then later we need to choose the optimal solution. Which will run at exponential time complexity.
## Subset program
- With n elements we can form 2<sup>n</sup> subsets.
