## Bubble sort 
- It is a implaced and stable alogrithm which is suitable for small sets upto 100 and 150 elements
- Time complexity
  1. Best Case - O(n)
  2. Worst Case - O(n^2)
  3. Average Case - O(n^2)
- Space complexity - O(1)
## Insertion sort
- It is a simple and stable state algorithm, which is not suitable for large states.
- Time complexity
  1. Best Case - O
