## Bubble sort 
- It is a implaced and stable alogrithm which is suitable for small sets upto 100 and 150 elements.
- Time complexity
  1. Best Case - O(n)
  2. Worst Case - O(n<sup>2)
  3. Average Case - O(n<sup>2)
- Space complexity - O(1)
## Insertion sort
- It is a simple and stable state algorithm, which is not suitable for large states.
- Time complexity
  1. Best Case - O(n)
  2. Average Case - O(n<sup>2)
  3. Worst Case - O(n<sup>2)
- Space complexity - O(1)
## Selection sort
- Selection sort is a implace and unstable algorithm, suitable for small sets where time complexity doesn't matter.
- Time complexity
  1. Best case - O(n<sup>2)
  2. Worst case - O(n<sup>2)
  3. Average case - O(n<sup>2)
- Space complexity - O(1)
