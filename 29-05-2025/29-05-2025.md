- When we work on a problem where we get time complexity 2<sup>n then we need to use dynamic programming for to solve this problem.
# Dynamic Programming
- Dynamic programming is an optimization based algorithm which is used to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping sub problems and storing there solutions to avoid rebundant execution of similar sub problems.
- The dynamic programming problem procedure
  1. over lapping subproblems
  2. optimal substitution
## Dynamic Programmin Approaches
1. Top - Down
   - The top-down method is also known as memorization.
   - We write the code in recursion.
   - We store the solutions
2. Bottom - Up
   - The bottom-up method is also known as tabulation.
   - We weite the code in iterative manner.
   - Fill Table/Array with solutions upto original problem.
   - We access the values based on index position.
## 0/1 Knapscak Problem
- Let us assume a knapsack with size 4.
- Let's assume the weights 
  - weights = { 1, 2, 3}
  - values = { 10, 15, 30}
- Now let's fill the knapsack with {1, 2} as we fill 3 the limit of the kanpsack will exceed. So, now the profit is 10 + 15 = 25
- Now let's assume other case {1, 3} as the bag is completely filled we cannot add other elements to the bag. So, now the profit is 10 + 30 = 40
