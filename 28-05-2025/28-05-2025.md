# Graphs
- A Graph is a nodes(vertices) that are connected by edges but not in hierarchy.
## Graphs Types
1. Undirected graph
   - The graphs that doesn't contain any directions or relation between two nodes.
   -  ```mermaid
      graph RL;
        A<-->B;
        A<-->C;
        B<-->D;
        C<-->D;
   ```
2. Directed graph
   - The graphs that does contain any direction or relation between two nodes.
3. Weighted graph
   - The graph whose edges are provided with a weight.
4. Unweighted graph
   - The graph whose edges are provided without a weight.
5. Connected graph
   - The graph in which whose all nodes are connected to each other.
6. Unconnected graph
   - The graph in which atleast one node is not connected to the graph.
7. Cyclic graph
   - The graph in which all the nodes are connected to form a circle.
8. Acyclic graph
   - The graph in which all nodes are connected but doesn't form a circle.
## Graph Creation
- Graphs are created by two ways
  1. Adjacency matrix
  2. Adjacency list
## Types of Traversal
1. BFS
2. DFS
