## N<sup>th</sup> catlon numbers
- Catalon numbers are having a variety of application in combinational mathematics
- Example,
  1. **Counting paranthesis**
  2. **BSTS**
  3. **Path in Grids**
- We can solve the **N<sup>th</sup> catlon numbers** using two methods
  1. **Using formula**
   - Formula, **\[\frac{(2n)!}{(n-1)! \cdot n!}\]**
  2. **Using recursion**
## Binomial Coefficient
- Binomial coefficient ${}^nC_k$ is often denoted as  $\binom{n}{k})$,represents the no.of ways to k elements from a set of n elements.
- To find binomail coefficeient, we have on formula $$\frac{(n)!}{(n-k)!\cdot(k)!}$$
## Least Common Multiple
- The LCM of two numbers can be find by using the formula $$LCM(a,b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{gcd(a,b)}$$
## Binary manipulation
### Addition without using + operator
- Any value incrementing without using **+** is by using bit manipulation **~10 = 11**.
### Swapping without using arthimetic operators
- Any value swapping without using swapping  bitwise (or) artimetic operators used is **XOR(^)**.
### Checking power of 2
- To check whether a number is power of 2, we need find the bit representation of the number **n** along with the bit representation of the number **n - 1**. Now we perform n & n - 1, if it returns 0's for all digits then it is power of 2.
### Checking the bit whether it is unset bit or set
- 1 is set bit
- 0 is unset bit
- We use the formula (n & (1 << k)) to check whether the number is set bit or unset bit.
### ZeroBit
- We count the no.of times it requires to change the number **N** to **zero**.
- We  use the formula n & (n - 1) and assign it to the n and use loop to repeat the process.
### Missing number
